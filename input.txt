# Description of this file:
#
# On the first line there is a revision number
# The second line contains the number of cycles x
# Then there are 2*x lines, each having the following structure:
# cycle-number cycle-direction-(l) number-of-neighbors neighbor-1 neighbor-2 ... neighbor-n
# cycle-number cycle-direction-(r) number-of-neighbors neighbor-1 neighbor-2 ... neighbor-n
# The neighbor-x entry has the following structure: IP":"port

# Sample follows:
